      <description>Exploring solutions in tech, climate, and culture I’m a Design Technologist in Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s Innovation Organization, focused on humans’ relationship to technology and the natural world. My goal is to contribute to impactful solutions that address the climate crisis in ways that foster a healthier relationship between our devices, our surroundings, and each other. This site serves as a way to document and share that progress with others.
While this blog represents the key things I&amp;rsquo;m focused on right now, you can find my portfolio website at mikeheavers.</description>
