<h3 id="please-enter-your-goals">&ldquo;Please enter your goals&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Twice a year at Mozilla I&rsquo;m asked to enter my goals for the next six months. On principle, that involves thinking about what I want to accomplish and where I want my career to head.</p>
<p>The format for formulating these goals is to take a look at the company&rsquo;s mission and vision as a whole, examine my org&rsquo;s objectives and key results (OKRs), and map my goals to the bigger picture. For reference, these were my goals for the first half of 2024:</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/2024-08-20-goals.jpg" alt="My H1 2024 Goals"></p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll notice the percentage bars - the idea being that, through the passage of time, we can quantify our progress on these lofty ambitions (when in doubt, just slide it to 100 ðŸ˜‰).</p>
<h3 id="start-with-a-personal-painpoint">&ldquo;Start with a personal painpoint&rdquo;</h3>
<p>In the startup world, a lot of people stick by this guiding principle for successful innovation: start with a personal painpoint.</p>
<p>My painpoint is that the world of technology I&rsquo;ve built around myself has started to feel pretty lonely. I spend a lot of time shouting into a void. Building things I think might be useful, only to find they&rsquo;ve either been done or are met with an inconclusive ambivalence. I have a feeling I&rsquo;m not alone.</p>
<p>In a survey of nearly 30,000 developers by Stack Overflow, <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/professional-developers#3-satisfied-at-current-job">only 20% report being happy at work</a>. And out of nearly 55,000 people, <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/professional-developers#3-satisfied-at-current-job">only 12% said they don&rsquo;t code outside of work</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/2024-08-20-satisfaction.jpg" alt="Only 20% of developers report being happy in a recent Stack Overflow survey"></p>
<p>For most of my career, that&rsquo;s been my story too. As a middling coder, I&rsquo;m constantly trying to read up and practice to stay relevant. To prove to myself that I was successful in this, I spent a lot of time blasting my progress out to all corners of the internet. I wanted to feel seen.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/10/humanism-skills-for-better-society-world/675745">a 2021 McKinsey Study</a>, when business execs were asked why employees were quitting their firms, the executives said it was to make more money elsewhere. But when researchers asked the <em>employees</em> why they quit, the most common answer was that they didnâ€™t feel recognized.</p>
<p>My social media strategy worked for awhile to make me feel seen, but at some point it really started to backfire. I felt lonely. Confused about where to focus my attention, and what to contribute. The internet these days is really crowded.</p>
<p>So, a bit reluctantly, and in seeming defeat, I resorted to something I&rsquo;d never done.  I started shutting the laptop at the end of the day, leaving it in the office, and turning my attention elsewhere - I took walks outside, I popped by friends&rsquo; houses unannounced, I joined community organizations.</p>
<p>Turns out that, while it takes a bit more effort than opening an app or typing in a URL, getting <em>away</em> from the places where millions of people congregate - (Instagram, X, Slack, Discord&hellip;), has helped me feel <em>more</em> seen. And this has made a huge difference in my stress levels, my mental health, and my feeling of self worth. I want that for anyone who&rsquo;s been feeling the same way I was.</p>
<h3 id="how-might-we">&ldquo;How might we&hellip;&rdquo;</h3>
<p>So here&rsquo;s an attempt at the old &ldquo;How Might We&rdquo; (HMW):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;How might we leverage people&rsquo;s connection with technology to facilitate more time connecting with each other in the real world?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I see two key pillars that make this possible: <strong>Presence and Recognition</strong></p>
<h3 id="recognition">Recognition</h3>
<p>In his <a href="https://archive.ph/AaYUe#selection-775.157-775.207">Humanist Manifesto</a>, David Brooks notes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In a healthy society, everybody is recognized to some degree. In an unhealthy society, recognition is doled out to the few&hellip;as though there were not enough of this precious substance to go around.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We all want to be acknowledged for the things that make us unique. Being seen, and seeing, creates bonds. Bonds create shared stories, customs and traditions. Through this we build an understanding of and an empathy for one other. And this, carried out over the course of tme, help us answer the hard, enduring, and meaningful questions, that are impossible to answer alone.</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t need a high like count or a thousand followers to feel recognized. We just need <em>witness</em> - the opportunity, ability, and willingness to <em>genuinely</em> see and be seen by others. That&rsquo;s difficult to do in a crowded room. It requires the other pillar.</p>
<h3 id="presence">Presence</h3>
<p>You&rsquo;ve no doubt read volumes about our culture&rsquo;s increasing sense of distraction, demands on productivity, lack of work life balance. <a href="https://newsletterss.com/post/2ZZLRA3uF0mgFHVxmUNDUZyRLY5/rss">Thomas Klaffke writes</a> that &ldquo;society today frames productivity in a way that only sees &lsquo;doing&rsquo; and excludes &lsquo;being&rsquo; - where downtime becomes negative space to fill rather than a moment to rest and reflect.</p>
<p>Technology is great at filling negative space. When life around you is not bustling, technology provides a portal to somewhere else that is bustling. And it&rsquo;s so full of shiny objects, all algorithmically curated to cater to you and keep you occupied.</p>
<p>But being occupied is not the same as being present. Presence requires stillness, and a rested, open mind, and a curiosity about others. Poet David Whyte calls this witness:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>â€œthe privilege of having been seen by someone and the equal privilege of being granted the sight of the essence of another&hellip; sometimes just to have accompanied them for however brief a span, on a journey impossible to accomplish alone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How can we flip the paradigm of technology such that it frees us up to be present instead of filling our empty space? Such that it brings us closer together instead of further apart?</p>
<p>I want technology that helps me find not the audience, but the one person in that audience who I can share a few steps of that journey. That&rsquo;s my &ldquo;H2 2024 OKR&rdquo; - to build things that help bring people together in the real world. I&rsquo;m not sure how I&rsquo;ll get that goal slider to 100% complete. Maybe I&rsquo;ll start by asking a friend.</p>
