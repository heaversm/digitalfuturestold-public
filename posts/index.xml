      <description>I believe that taking meaningful restorative action for the planet starts with changing our culture, and that culture change requires an understanding of other ways of being. In my own search for alternatives, I read &amp;ldquo;How It Is&amp;rdquo;, by Viola Cordova - a Jicarilla Apache / Hispanic professor of classical Western &amp;amp; Native American philosophy. In Viola&amp;rsquo;s words, &amp;ldquo;I study white people.&amp;rdquo; The book helped me see blindspots in my own world view, as well as insights into a belief system that might make that culture shift possible.</description>

      <description>I love to travel. In fact, for the last 25 years I had made it a goal to visit at least one new country a year, because to me, travel felt like the marker of a life fully lived. So when, after 2 years of pandemic isolation, my company resumed its annual all-company offsite meeting in Hawaii, I should have been ecstatic. It was after all not just travel, but free travel.</description>

      <description>In October I gave a quick (5 minute) lightning talk at Mozilla about the environmental impact of using AI vs. the potential environmental benefits. In the talk I make a Deep Fake of myself and estimate the energy usage in creating it.
You can watch the video at the link above, but here&amp;rsquo;s a summary of things I learned in the process:
GPT3 required an estimated 85,000 kg of CO2 to train.</description>

      <description>After years of knowing the facts, but feeling paralyzed by inaction about climate change, I read a book by Jonathan Safran Foer called We are the Weather, which illucidated 3 easy personal actions we can all take toward saving the planet. If every human did this, we would singlehandedly meet the targets set in the targets for greenhouse gas emissions set forth in the Paris Agreement
1. No meat before dinner Depending on how you do your accounting, animal agriculture accounts for 24 to &amp;gt;57% of greeenhouse gas emissions.</description>
