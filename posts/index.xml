      <description>It&#39;s getting hot in here... The best indicator we have for the severity of our myriad environmental issues is the temperature of our planet. And it&#39;s getting hotter everywhere, as seen below in this graph of global temperature anomalies. While a few degrees might not seem like a lot, even 2 degrees change would equate to about 15 feet of sea level rise. The level of CO2 in our atmosphere makes this problem worse - locking that heat in to our atmosphere for thousands of years, despite improvements we may make on carbon reduction.</description>

      <description>At some point this past year I started highlighting key takeaways in my climate research. Here I&amp;rsquo;ve synthesized some of the top facts and figures that stood out in 2022
Climate Change We need to be making more progress faster:
Of the 40 indicators of global warming-limiting measures of progress established by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, none are on track to reach their 2030 targets. Six are heading in the right direction at a promising but insufficient speed, while 21 are also trending in the right direction but well below the required pace.</description>

      <title>Calculating Product Carbon Emissions with Ditch Carbon</title>

      <description>Youtube Video Walkthrough
Every Year Mozilla conducts its Privacy Not Included product review - evaluating products on their level of Privacy, Security, and use of AI.
I wanted to see if next year we can include the energy usage or carbon footprint of these products in the review. So I decided to build a carbon footprint calculator for the products in this year&amp;rsquo;s privacy not included review as a prototype in order to hopefully persuade the team to include it next year.</description>

      <title>A Carbon Calculator for Company Travel</title>

      <description>Try it out here
My company hosted its annual off-site trip for all 1000+ employees in Hawaii. In the process of trying to estimate and understand the implications of this on the environment, I built a tool that estimates the carbon for multiple people traveling to a single destination.
Why Do We Need This? Flying is one of the most carbon intensive activities an individual can do. A single flight emits more CO2 than a single person in Uganda does in a year.</description>

      <description>I believe that taking meaningful restorative action for the planet starts with changing our culture, and that culture change requires an understanding of other ways of being. In my own search for alternatives, I read &amp;ldquo;How It Is&amp;rdquo;, by Viola Cordova - a Jicarilla Apache / Hispanic professor of classical Western &amp;amp; Native American philosophy. In Viola&amp;rsquo;s words, &amp;ldquo;I study white people.&amp;rdquo; The book helped me see blindspots in my own world view, as well as insights into a belief system that might make that culture shift possible.</description>

      <description>I love to travel. In fact, for the last 25 years I had made it a goal to visit at least one new country a year, because to me, travel felt like the marker of a life fully lived. So when, after 2 years of pandemic isolation, my company resumed its annual all-company offsite meeting in Hawaii, I should have been ecstatic. It was after all not just travel, but free travel.</description>

      <description>In October I gave a quick (5 minute) lightning talk at Mozilla about the environmental impact of using AI vs. the potential environmental benefits. In the talk I make a Deep Fake of myself and estimate the energy usage in creating it.
You can watch the video at the link above, but here&amp;rsquo;s a summary of things I learned in the process:
GPT3 required an estimated 85,000 kg of CO2 to train.</description>

      <description>After years of knowing the facts, but feeling paralyzed by inaction about climate change, I read a book by Jonathan Safran Foer called We are the Weather, which illucidated 3 easy personal actions we can all take toward saving the planet. If every human did this, we would singlehandedly meet the targets set in the targets for greenhouse gas emissions set forth in the Paris Agreement
1. No meat before dinner Depending on how you do your accounting, animal agriculture accounts for 24 to &amp;gt;57% of greeenhouse gas emissions.</description>
