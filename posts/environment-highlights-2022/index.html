      <p>At some point this past year I started highlighting key takeaways in my climate research. Here I&rsquo;ve synthesized some of the top facts and figures that stood out in 2022</p>
<h2 id="climate-change">Climate Change</h2>
<p><strong>We need to be making more progress faster</strong>:</p>
<p>Of the 40 indicators of global warming-limiting measures of progress established by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, <a href="https://www.wri.org/research/state-climate-action-2022">none are on track to reach their 2030 targets</a>. Six are heading in the right direction at a promising but insufficient speed, while 21 are also trending in the right direction but well below the required pace. Five indicators are trending in the wrong direction entirely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reducing fossil fuel use in electricity generation (at 24% vs 17% needed)</li>
<li>Reduce % of kilometers traveled by passenger car (at 44% vs 34% needed)</li>
<li>Reduce mangrove loss (at 32,000 hectares per year vs 4,900 hectares needed)</li>
<li>Reduce GHG from agriculture by 22% (at 5.8 Gigatons/yr, need 4.6 gigaton)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The exponential effects of Global Warming</strong>:</p>
<p>At 2 degrees of Global Warming, in many parts of the world, floods that used to hit once a century <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/srocc/">would come every single year</a>, and those that came once a century would be beyond all historical experience. The effects would be uneven: In India, by the end of the century, there would be 30 times as many severe heat waves as today, according to one estimate. Ninety-three times as many people would be exposed there to dangerous heat.</p>
<p>The number of people exposed to extreme smoke days in the American West <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.2c02934">has already grown 27-fold</a> in the last decade.</p>
<p>Drought across the Northern Hemisphere was made <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/10/26/magazine/climate-change-warming-world.html">20 times more likely by climate change this year</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/06/30/opinion/environmental-inequity-trees-critical-infrastructure.html">We can expect up to a tenfold increase in heat-related deaths in the eastern United States by the latter half of the 2050s</a></p>
<p>The number of vertebrates that have gone extinct over the last 100 years <a href="https://www.reuters.com/graphics/GLOBAL-ENVIRONMENT/EXTINCT/lbvgggdgevq/">should have taken 800 - 10,000 years</a></p>
<p>Once emitted, <a href="https://learn.greensoftware.foundation/climate-commitments">carbon remains in the atmosphere for 5,000 years</a>.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-take-action">How to take action</h2>
<p>One of the best ways to create impact is to donate. Recommended climate charities have in the past averted a tonne of CO2 for less than $10. Not all charities are equal. You can often 100x impact by supporting top rated charities <a href="https://founderspledge.com/stories/climate-and-lifestyle-report">according to Founder&rsquo;s Pledge</a>.</p>
<p>In the West, <a href="https://founderspledge.com/stories/climate-and-lifestyle-report">having one fewer child has a 20-30X greater impact than any other individual action</a>, followed by going car-free, switching to green heating, or taking one less transatlantic flight (<em>I would argue that living in less square footage with more people should make that list&hellip;</em>)</p>
<h2 id="climate-justice">Climate Justice</h2>
<p><strong>Tackling climate starts with tackling inequality</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/carbon-emissions-richest-1-set-be-30-times-15degc-limit-2030">The carbon emissions of richest 1% set to be 30 times the 1.5¬∞C limit in 2030</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.wri.org/un-climate-change-conference-resource-hub/key-issues-cop27">The African continent is responsible for only 3% of global CO2 emissions</a>, yet it is on the front lines of the world‚Äôs climate, energy and food crises - home to 60% of the world‚Äôs poorest people, who are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.</p>
<p><a href="https://founderspledge.com/stories/climate-and-lifestyle-report">The average American emits 18 tonnes of CO2 per year. The average Indian, 1/10th of that</a></p>
<p>Rich Americans enjoy almost 50 percent more greenery in their environment compared with lower-income communities. The average temperature can <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/116/15/7575">vary up to 10 degrees</a> between places with trees and those without.</p>
<p>More vegetation near a building contributed to 52 percent fewer crimes overall and 56 percent fewer violent crimes according to <a href="https://www.vibrantcitieslab.com/resources/environment-and-crime-in-the-inner-city/">one study</a></p>
<p><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/deforestation">95% of deforestation occurs in the tropics</a>. 71% of this is driven by demand in domestic markets, and the remaining 29% for the production of products that are traded. High-income countries were the largest ‚Äòimporters‚Äô of deforestation, accounting for 40% of it. 79% of exported deforestation ended up in those countries that had stopped losing domestic forests.</p>
<h2 id="sustainability-by-sector">Sustainability by Sector</h2>
<p><strong>Food and Agriculture</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/10/28/opinion/climate-change-bret-stephens.html">Agriculture uses about 70 percent of the world‚Äôs freshwater supply.</a></p>
<p><strong>Energy</strong></p>
<p>The US grid is currently <a href="https://founderspledge.com/stories/climate-and-lifestyle-report">32% gas, 30% coal, 20% nuclear</a> (82% of total), and the remainder is mainly hydro and wind.</p>
<p>Solar capacity in the United States <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/10/26/magazine/climate-change-warming-world.html">has risen nearly 300-fold since 2008, to 130.9 gigawatts in 2022</a>. Solar energy could account for as much as 45 percent of the U.S. electricity supply by 2050.</p>
<p><strong>Transportation</strong></p>
<p>Cycling is ten times more important than electric cars for reaching net-zero cities. People who cycled on a daily basis had 84% lower carbon emissions from all their daily travel than those who didn‚Äôt. Taking into account the carbon generated by making the vehicle, fuelling it and disposing of it, <a href="(https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trd.2021.102764)">emissions from cycling can be more than 30 times lower for each trip than driving a fossil fuel car, and about ten times lower than driving an electric one</a>.</p>
<p>Just <a href="https://founderspledge.com/stories/climate-and-lifestyle-report">one roundtrip transatlantic flight contributes nearly a quarter of the annual emissions of the average Swede</a>. Flying first class would produce nearly the entire annual emissions of the average Swede.</p>
<p><strong>Technology</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://gerrymcgovern.com/books/world-wide-waste/">From the book World Wide Waste</a>:</p>
<p>Around 90% of data is never accessed three months after it is first stored. Businesses typically only analyze around 10% of the data they collect. 90% of all sensor data collected from Smart Home devices is never used. The average app loses 77% of its users within the first three days after the install.</p>
<p>1.6 billion trees would have to be planted to offset the pollution caused by email spam. 1.5 billion trees would need to be planted to deal with annual e-commerce returns in the US alone. 231 million trees would need to be planted to deal with the pollution caused as a result of the data US citizens consumed in 2019.</p>
<p>As of 2021, <a href="https://nadia.xyz/climate-tribes">climate tech accounts for 14 cents of every venture capital dollar</a></p>
