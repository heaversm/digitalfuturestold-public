      <description>Evolving with AI Principles we need adapt to the Collective Intelligence era. In early 2024 I found myself prototyping an AI system that foreshadows my own replacement. It was a moment I figured would come, just not so quickly.
AI is ideally suited to take on the work of language, specifically the language of computers. As a result software developers like me are getting an early taste of what happens when an employee is asked to play an active role in automating their own profession.</description>

      <description>Gods of Mexico is a captivating portrait of indigenous peoples of Mexico who still maintain centuries old traditions and ways of living.
The film centers on the concept of white and black - starting with a traditional process of making salt: collecting briny water, spreading it under the sun in terraced salt pans, digging a pit to forge a lime kiln. It ends with a depiction of miners toiling in the bowels of an industrial mine using far more extractive practices, and between these are couched Black and White portraits of traditional peoples of Mexico.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been searching out deeper connections lately. Older. Time-tested. Wilder. More expressive. Reaching out to distanced friends and unique individuals. Doing hard, uncomfortable things. Digging way back into my music collection (and listening to the songs all the way through). Trying to remove all the filters (there are a so many filters!)
Seems to me like we live under pressure to optimize every aspect of our life - biohacking and optimizing our way to perfection (and exhaustion), or employing systems to control things for us: infinitely customizing, quantifying, synthesizing, and automating.</description>

      <description>This book helped me to understand that some of the frustration and sadness I feel in life is not stress, or depression, or some sort of chemical imbalance - but unacknowledged and unexplored grief - within myself, passed down from my ancestors, grief absorbed from the world around me.
On Grief &amp;ldquo;To feel sorrow is to float on the pulse of the earth, the surge from living to dying. Maybe this is why the earth has the power over time to wash sorrow into a deeper pool, cold and shadowed.</description>

      <description>Technology as a means to humanity &amp;ldquo;Please enter your goals&amp;rdquo; Twice a year at Mozilla I&amp;rsquo;m asked to enter my goals for the next six months. On principle, that involves thinking about what I want to accomplish and where I want my career to head.
The format for formulating these goals is to take a look at the company&amp;rsquo;s mission and vision as a whole, examine my org&amp;rsquo;s objectives and key results (OKRs), and map my goals to the bigger picture.</description>

      <description>Getting Unstuck Finding unsolved problems these days in technology in which you, uniquely, are suited to tackle, and can make money is like finding a needle in a haystack. This is precisely my task at Mozilla Innovation, and as such, I can sometimes feel stuck, especially when outnumbered and outspent by tech&amp;rsquo;s dominant players.
This excellent post from Experimental History&amp;rsquo;s Adam Mastroianni summed up many of the logic fallacies that trip us up on our way to progress.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;If you don&amp;rsquo;t know me and I you, a pattern that others put in place may prevail in the world.&amp;rdquo; - Malidoma Somé
1. Focus on the living. Last year I ended a long term relationship, the latter years through which I felt I was mostly sleepwalking. In the aftermath I found countless examples of how the lifestyle I designed for myself - one focused on achievement, speed, novelty, and scale - was getting in the way of human connection.</description>

      <description>In &amp;ldquo;Where the Water Goes&amp;rdquo; author David Owen follows the Colorado River from its high-altitude headwaters to its eventual, trickling desert end - every drop over-promised, underdelivered, or disputed along the way. The system now has an average “structural deficit” of 1.2 million acre-feet a year, &amp;ldquo;which is equivalent to covering almost four Phoenixes with a foot of water&amp;rdquo; (source).
What to do? There&amp;rsquo;s no shortage of attempted solutions. The thing that struck me while reading this book though, was how often some unforeseen downstream circumstance counteracts a seemingly intuitive water management practice.</description>

      <description>Work in tech and you&amp;rsquo;ll hear a lot about Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) these days. You know the story - our rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence will soon produce a computer whose thinking is on par with the human brain. The tantalizing logic leap is that general intelligence means human intelligence means we&amp;rsquo;re all replaceable, or worse, under existential threat. And the presumption is that the source of our unseating is the Large Language Model (LLM).</description>

      <description>I spend a lot of my time at Mozilla these days building prototypes that incorporate some aspect of artificial intelligence and, subsequently, inescapably, considering the impact of such developments on humans. My thoughts often wander, unsurprisingly, to my own future as a developer and reluctant tech user.
There has been plenty written about how AI will replace or shift jobs, and my own career as a mid-level designer / dev hybrid is certainly far from safe.</description>

      <description>Human intelligence is especially dependent on our ability to acquire knowledge efficiently from other humans (culture). Can AI learn to teach itself through cultural transmission?
The Research In a paper published in nature researchers from DeepMind posited that, &amp;ldquo;since cultural transmission is an ever-present feature of human social behaviour,&amp;rdquo; and since it &amp;ldquo;is the process that underlies the evolution of culture&amp;rdquo;, it &amp;ldquo;is a skill that an artificially intelligent agent should possess to facilitate beneficial human-AI interaction.</description>

      <description>James Bridle posits that the natural world should play an essential part of our technological future, a role that is currently being overwhelmingly ignored.
‘We are now living in a global state that has been structured for the benefit of non-human entities with non-human goals.
Ways of Being spends its time examining human and non-human technology, their inseparable codependence, and how &amp;ldquo;an ecology of technology&amp;rdquo; is essential to our long-term survival as a species.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about the senses, and about how much our culture favors the visual one. As a result a lot of my experiments of late delve into the auditory realm. In reading Jame&amp;rsquo;s Bridle&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Ways of Being&amp;rdquo;, though, I began to wonder about another sense we might possess, which is attunement to change through the passage of time.
This is the concept of Phenology - the study of not how things appear, but when.</description>

      <description>Using OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s APIs is an easy way to get up and running with building AI driven applications, but what will these services cost you, and what are the implications in terms of energy usage and efficiency versus other non-AI driven options? How do you isolate the cost and energy of a specific user interaction with AI?
In this video, we&amp;rsquo;ll use the Firefox Energy Profiler to understand the energy usage of AI inference with OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s API, utilizing both the Whisper Transcription API, and ChatGPT 3.</description>

      <description>As the Innovation Studio team at Mozilla has been ramping up its investigation into responsible AI, it&amp;rsquo;s become clear that we need to consider the environmental impact of the tools we build. I was asked to put together a quick primer on initial considerations.
Why prioritize sustainability in AI AI Model Training utilizes cloud GPUs that require 10–15 times the energy a traditional CPU (source) Training an LLM such as GPT-4 is estimated to take up to 300 tons of CO2e (source) NVIDIA estimates that 80-90% of the energy cost of neural networks lies in ongoing inference processing after a model has been trained (source).</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;A chorus of living wood sings to the woman, ‘if your mind were only a slightly greener thing, we’d drown you in meaning’.” - The Overstory, Richard Powers
I recently attended Terra.do&amp;rsquo;s Climate Farm School, which asks attendees to examine innovation in our food systems in the wake of climate change. The experience was so positive and essential to my understanding of what we eat and how it contributes to the health of our planet, that I started to wonder whether such a course might not be a requirement of all people who wish to grow food, or eat the food grown by others.</description>

      <description>Imagining a Better Food System I recently enrolled in Terra.do&amp;rsquo;s Climate Farm School course, and one of our assignments was to picture the food system in 2040. In the process of thinking through what this might look like for myself, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d build a tool to help others do the same.
Using chatGPT4&amp;rsquo;s ability to create both textual completions and images, I set up a brief mad lib style questionnaire.</description>

      <description>The Past: Latent Space When I first started learning AI, I was fascinated by this thing called “The Latent Space” - a way of essentially opening up a an AI’s brain in training to see what it imagines as it attempts to make sense of the Human World.
I loved the weird imperfection and unexpected surprises. I thought this would be an amazing tool in the hands of an artist - but the technical barriers were high.</description>

      <description>In a pre- Sam Bankman Fried past longtermism held more intrigue for me. I&amp;rsquo;ve since developed an aversion to an ideology that places the preservation of human life at the forefront of all environmental decision making. Nevertheless, I am intrigued by the thought of always keeping &amp;ldquo;the most good for the most amount of people&amp;rdquo; at the forefront of decisionmaking, as well as longtermism&amp;rsquo;s efforts to evaluate the likelihood of various environmental futures.</description>

      <description>After running the numbers on the flights to Hawaii for Mozilla&#39;s all-hands meeting, I resolved to make my next business trip by a more sustainable air-travel alternative. The opportunity came via a training in our San Francisco offices, just near enough to Portland to consider traveling by train, car, or bus. I knew flights from Portland to the bay were cheap, numerous and, most enticingly, fast. One hour and fifty minutes, one hundred and fifty bucks (with enough advance purchase and flexibility).</description>

      <description>It&#39;s getting hot in here... The best indicator we have for the severity of our myriad environmental issues is the temperature of our planet. And it&#39;s getting hotter everywhere, as seen below in this graph of global temperature anomalies. While a few degrees might not seem like a lot, even 2 degrees change would equate to about 15 feet of sea level rise. The level of CO2 in our atmosphere makes this problem worse - locking that heat in to our atmosphere for thousands of years, despite improvements we may make on carbon reduction.</description>

Climate Change We need to be making more progress faster:
Of the 40 indicators of global warming-limiting measures of progress established by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, none are on track to reach their 2030 targets. Six are heading in the right direction at a promising but insufficient speed, while 21 are also trending in the right direction but well below the required pace.</description>

Try it out here
My company hosted its annual off-site trip for all 1000+ employees in Hawaii. In the process of trying to estimate and understand the implications of this on the environment, I built a tool that estimates the carbon for multiple people traveling to a single destination.
Why Do We Need This? Flying is one of the most carbon intensive activities an individual can do. A single flight emits more CO2 than a single person in Uganda does in a year.</description>

      <description>I believe that taking meaningful restorative action for the planet starts with changing our culture, and that culture change requires an understanding of other ways of being. In my own search for alternatives, I read &amp;ldquo;How It Is&amp;rdquo;, by Viola Cordova - a Jicarilla Apache / Hispanic professor of classical Western &amp;amp; Native American philosophy. In Viola&amp;rsquo;s words, &amp;ldquo;I study white people.&amp;rdquo; The book helped me see blindspots in my own world view, as well as insights into a belief system that might make that culture shift possible.</description>

It was after all not just travel, but free travel.</description>

      <description>Exploring solutions in tech, climate, and culture I’m a Design Technologist in Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s Innovation Organization, focused on humans’ relationship to technology and the natural world. My goal is to contribute to impactful solutions that address the climate crisis in ways that foster a healthier relationship between our devices, our surroundings, and each other. This site serves as a way to document and share that progress with others.
While this blog represents the key things I&amp;rsquo;m focused on right now, you can find my portfolio website at mikeheavers.</description>
